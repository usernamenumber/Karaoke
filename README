Overview:
This (as yet un-named) project is a set of tools used for hosting karaoke parties. The novel thing about it is that while the karaoke-player
component plays through the queue, anyone at the party can point their laptop at the karaoke system and use the web interface provided 
by karaoke-webapp to browse and add tracks. 

Dependencies:
ID3.py	http://id3-py.sourceforge.net/
web.py	http://webpy.org/
pygame	http://pygame.org/
pycdg	http://www.kibosh.org/pykaraoke/
simplejson http://pypi.python.org/pypi/simplejson

Getting started:
1) Install the dependencies
2) Create a config file (run karaoke-update.py with no args for an example)
3) Run ./karaoke-updatedb.py configfile
4) Run ./karaoke-webapp.py configfile
5) Point your web browser at the url given and populate a playlist
6) Run ./karaoke-player.py configfile

While in karaoke-player.py, 'n' can be used to skip to the next track and 'q'
can be used to quit. 

You can also quickly play either a single .cdg file or a .pls file with one /path/to/file.cdg per line with ./quickplay whatever.pls
